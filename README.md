Update: With the use of yosys read_verilog command, now the bitstream can be generated.

# yosys issue : Project with mixed Verilog and VHDL generate wrong cell  

This repro try to show that yosys generate wrong cell for mixed vhdl and verilog project. The last version of yosys that this project can generate a bitstream is  [cdb57118758f855518ad416d12728d72bff58c10](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/commit/cdb57118758f855518ad416d12728d72bff58c10)

Also the mixed HDL example from [fomu-workshop](https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-workshop/tree/master/hdl/mixed/blink) have the same problem.


## Context
This project implement a barrel shifter for Lattice ECP5 device in vhdl and use a pll generated by ecppll in verilog (pll.v).  


## The Problem
For this project, yosys should synthetize a EHXPLLL cell from verilog source for nextpnr-ecp5. Version of yosys after cdb5711 <u>synthetize a ECP5PLL cell which is the name given to the module</u> generated form ecppll.  

```
nextpnr-ecp5  -r --25k  --json BarrelShifter.json --textcfg BarrelShifter.config --package CABGA256 --speed 6 --freq 50 --lpf-allow-unconstrained
